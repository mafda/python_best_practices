# Python Best Practices

We can use a simple deck of programs to get our [code
styling](https://medium.com/semantixbr/how-to-make-your-code-shine-with-gitlab-ci-pipelines-48ade99192d1)
done. We can use isort for sorting the library imports (yes, imports have a
suggested order), we can check the existence of undesired artifacts using Flake8
and Pylint, and keep the code within the same style using Black.

Those tools can be configured to be [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
compliant. PEP8 â€” Python Enhancement Proposal, is a style guide that provides
guidelines and best practices suggestions on how to write Python code.

## Python tools

* Importing sorting with [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)
* Formatting with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) 
* Linting with [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) 
* Bug and quality checker with [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/)

## Project Setup

### Clone this repository

```shell
(base)$: git clone 
(base)$: cd python-best-practices 
```

### Configure environment

- Create the conda environment

```shell
(base)$: conda env create -f environment-dev.yml
```

- Or update with **development dependencies**

```shell
(base)$: conda env update -n your-project -f environment-dev.yml
```

- Activate the environment

```shell
(base)$: conda activate best-practices
```

## Using tools and clean your code!

```shell
(best-practices)$: cd your-project
```

### isort

You could use `isort .` or `isort . --check-only`

### black

You could use `black --line-length 79 .` or `black --line-length 79 --check .`

### flake8

You could use `flake8 .`

### pylint

You could use `find . -type f -name "*.py" | xargs pylint`
